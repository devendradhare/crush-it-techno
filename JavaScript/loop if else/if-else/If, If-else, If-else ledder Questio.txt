If, If-else, If-else ledder Question

1 If Statement Question:
Write a program that takes an integer as input and determines whether it is even or odd. Output "Even" if the number is even, and "Odd" if it's odd.
Input: An integer number.

2 If-Else Statement Question:
Write a program to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. If the year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year. However, if it is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400. Output "Leap Year" if it's a leap year, and "Not a Leap Year" otherwise.
Input: A year (integer).

3 If-Else-If Ladder Question:
Write a program that takes three integers as input and prints the largest among them. If all are equal, output any one of them.
Input: Three integers.

4 Nested If-Else Question:
Write a program to determine the grade of a student based on their marks. The criteria for grading are as follows:

Grade A: Marks >= 90
Grade B: Marks >= 80 and < 90
Grade C: Marks >= 70 and < 80
Grade D: Marks >= 60 and < 70
Grade F: Marks < 60
Output the corresponding grade based on the marks obtained.
Input: Marks obtained by a student (integer).

5 Multiple Conditions in If Statement Question:
Write a program that takes three integers as input representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Determine and output whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
Input: Three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

6 Boolean Logic in If-Else Question:
Write a program that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not according to the following conditions:

If the year is divisible by 4, it's a leap year.
If it is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.
Output "Leap Year" if it's a leap year, and "Not a Leap Year" otherwise.
Input: A year (integer).

7 If-Else with Array Processing Question:
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and finds the smallest and largest element in the array. Output both the smallest and largest elements.
Input: An array of integers.

8 If-Else with Recursion Question:
Write a recursive function to find the factorial of a non-negative integer. Output the factorial of the given integer.
Input: A non-negative integer for which the factorial needs to be calculated.

9 If-Else with String Processing Question:
Write a program that takes a string as input and determines whether it is a palindrome or not. Output "Palindrome" if it's a palindrome, and "Not a Palindrome" otherwise.
Input: A string.

10 If-Else with File Processing Question:
Write a program that reads integers from a text file. Classify each integer as positive or negative, and calculate the sum of positive integers and the sum of negative integers separately. Output both the sums.
Input: Integers stored in a text file.
